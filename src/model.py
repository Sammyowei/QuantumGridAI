model.py
--------
This file builds the AI brain (LSTM model) that will predict electricity demand.

LSTM stands for "Long Short-Term Memory" â€” it is a smart type of AI 
that is very good at learning patterns over time, like:

- Morning electricity usage goes up
- Afternoon is moderate
- Evening peaks when everyone comes home

We give it 24 hours, and it tries to predict the 25th hour.

    Create and compile a simple LSTM model.

    - time_steps: how many past hours the model will look at (like 24 hours)
    - features: how many columns of input data we have (usually 1 for single load)
